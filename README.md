# üåê Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in a clear and professional manner while providing an engaging way for visitors to learn more about me. It consists of multiple sections, including a homepage that introduces the site, an about page that highlights my background and interests, and a skills page where I present the technologies, tools, and frameworks I am proficient in. The overall design is simple yet modern, with a strong focus on accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring that the website performs well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The portfolio has been built using core web technologies: HTML5 provides the structure for each page, CSS3 handles the styling and layout to give the site a clean and polished appearance, and JavaScript brings interactivity to the pages to make the user experience more dynamic. No external frameworks were used, which keeps the project lightweight and makes it easy to customize or extend in the future. The project also includes images, such as a profile logo, to personalize the content and create a stronger visual identity.

If you would like to see the portfolio in action, a live demo can be hosted using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, and the link can be shared here once deployed. Adding screenshots of the homepage, about page, and skills page is also encouraged to provide visitors with a quick preview of the design and layout. While this is primarily a personal project, I welcome contributions and suggestions for improvement. Forking the repository and submitting pull requests is encouraged for those who wish to collaborate.

This project represents not only a professional portfolio but also a demonstration of my ability to build functional, responsive, and visually appealing websites from the ground up. It serves as an evolving space where I can add new projects, update my skills, and continually refine the design. If you would like to get in touch, I am available on GitHub, LinkedIn, or by email, and my contact details can be included in this section. The repository is licensed under the MIT License, which allows others to freely use and modify the code with proper attribution.
