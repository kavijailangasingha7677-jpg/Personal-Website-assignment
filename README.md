# üåê Personal Portfolio Website

The source code of my personal portfolio site can be found here. The site will be tailored in a manner that clearly presents my abilities, projects and experiences professionally and yet give visitors a concise and exciting way of learning more about me. It is divided into several parts, such as a homepage in which I provide the introduction to the site; an about page, in which I would outline my background and my interests, and a skills page, where I would outline the technologies, tools, and frameworks, of which I am familiar. Designing is straightforward but stylish with great emphasis on accessibility and responsiveness hence making the site user-friendly in all desktops, tablets and other mobile devices.

The corner web technologies have been utilized in the building of the portfolio, with HTML5 acting as the frame on each page, CSS3 to deal with the styling and layout to give the site the clean and polished look and JavaScript to add the interactivity to the pages so as to make the user experience more interactive. No third-party structures were involved, making the project easy to maintain and amend in future. Images are also the part of the project: the logo of the profile to make everything a bit more personal and a more vivid identity.

In case you would like to check that the portfolio works, you can use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to host a live demo of the portfolio and place its link on this page after it is deployed. It is also advisable to include screen captures of the home page, about page and skills page to give a quick preview of the design and layout to the visitors. This is more of a personal project, but I am open to any contribution and suggestions on how to better it. People willing to collaborate are encouraged to fork the repository and make requests.

The project is more than a professional portfolio because it is a demonstration of my skill in creating functional, responsive and appealing websites on a bottom up approach. It is also a continuously developing area in which I can introduce new projects, refresh my abilities, and carefully adjust the design. I am also accessible on instagram: GitHub, LinkedIn, and email, so I can provide my contact information in this section. The repository is also under the MIT License where it will simply be used freely by anyone under the condition that they give credit to whatever they edited.
